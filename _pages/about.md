Welcome to my website!  
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biostatistics and Data Science at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth). Additionally, I work as a Research Assistant at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

### Research Interests

My research focuses on developing statistical methods combined with AI/ML algorithms for various types of genetic and genomic data, including:

- Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data
- DNA methylation data
- Spatial transcriptomics
- Image data  
  
My work includes mendelian randomization, multiple association testing, multi-omics data analysis, and AI/ML modelling. I also have rich experience in dealing with electronic health records (EHR) data, including developing phenotyping algorithm and clustering. To practice and facilitate reproducible research, I have developed and currently maintain several software (most in R packages) and their online manuals.


### Current Project

I am currently developing a new framework to predict high-resolution spatial transcriptomics. This innovative approach combines deep learning algorithms with a Bayesian-inspired method to facilitate uncertainty quantification and downstream analysis.
